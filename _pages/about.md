Hi, my name is Cyril Chhun and this is my academic website. I am currently a Ph.D student at Télécom Paris, working on Automatic Story Generation and Evaluation.

For all my non-academic content, you may want to visit my [blog](https://lashoun.com) and my [Obsidian vault](https://lashoun.com/notes).

## My PhD so far

Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled language models to produce ever more realistic texts. In my PhD, I study the performance of state-of-the-art models at the task of Automatic Story Generation. In a [first publication](https://lashoun.github.io/publication/2022-08-24-hanna-benchmark), we performed a meta-evaluation of ASG evaluation and showed, among other things, that: (1) current systems remain significantly inferior to human writers w.r.t. a proposed set of specific ASG criteria, and (2) current automatic metrics correlate poorly with those criteria. Thus, I am now searching for (1) automatic metrics which are more relevant to ASG evaluation, and (2) strategies for improving the quality of generated stories w.r.t. to ASG criteria.
